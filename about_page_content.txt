About Us

TeachUs is a community by teachers, for teachers.

We aim to connect teachers across India to come forth and teach each other how to shift to the online mode of education. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced both students and teachers alike to rely on online resources to learn and teach.
For many teachers, this shift has been far from pleasant.
We offer many courses and resources to make your journey in online teaching as smooth as possible. We have created a community for teachers where you can share your thoughts and views regarding anything and everything - be it the latest tool to conduct pop quizzes, or the best tool to conduct meetings virtually.

TeachUs aims to teach those who have spent years teaching us :)

We are sophomores from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. Driven by a desire to help our teachers adjust to this new normal, we decided to build TeachUs - an app to teach those who have spent years teaching us!
